            <div class = "whitebanner2">Athletes<br></div>
            <p class = "intro">There have been many improvements to gender equality in sport over the years. Since 2012 women have competed
                in an equal number of sports as men at the Olympic games. Women’s exposure in sports has generally been unequal, 
                making up just 7% of all sports media coverage in the UK. The interest in watching women’s sport is on the rise. 
                Tennis, swimming, and athletics are all becoming equally popular to watch for both men and women. Other sports
                like women’s football, rugby and cricket people are less interested in watching. This is likely to change in 
                the near future. <br><br>
                With such role models as Steph Houghton, Nicola Adams, Serena Williams, and many more its no wonder the next 
                generation of women in sport is expected to bring more equality and empowerment both in sporting events and the media.

            <p class="intro">
            Many women from sporting backgrounds also pursue careers related to sport. Some become sports management consultants, 
            some become presenters etc. Old Arsenal defender Alex Scott faced lots of sexist comments when entering the world of 
            sports presenting, however she has since become a respected BBC sports presenter that is only on the rise. Clare Balding 
            has worked with ITV, BT and BBC as a female sports presenter and has become a face of female sports reporting. Balding
                is an award-winning sports presenter, former jockey with an OBE who has heavily worked in the world of football media.

            <div class = "whitebanner2">Accountancy<br></div>
            <p class="intro">
                There are 73,000 full-time chartered accountants and women make up 32,000 of these. In the UK, 44% of full-time 
                accountants are female. In some cases, there are more women applying to accountancy firms than there are men for 
                the first time in the firm’s histories. There is still a way to go with closing the gender gap in this line of work, 
                however. While nearly half of people joining this profession are female, less than 25% of them are partners. This 
                means there is still a need for ambitious and hard-working women to break the glass ceiling and gain those more senior 
                roles.

            <div class = "whitebanner2">Insurance and Acturial<br></div>
            <p class="intro">
            It has been 97 years since the first woman actuary qualified in the UK. In 2013 women made up just 23% of qualified 
            actuaries but there has been an increasing proportion of women in the profession. With a larger number of women in the
            profession nowadays it is unlikely a woman would feel uncomfortable and alone in a male dominated environment. Women 
            made up 40% of new entrants to the profession meaning this profession is increasingly encouraging to young women. As
            with the rest of the corporate world it is difficult to see women at more senior levels. This just emphasises the 
            need for more determined and enthusiastic women in this sector to bring the equality to the more senior roles that 
            is required.

            <div class = "whitebanner2">Technology<br></div>
            <p class="intro">
            Astonishingly 5% of females hold leadership positions in technology, 78% of students cannot name a single famous woman working in
            technology, and 3% of females say a career in technology is their first choice. This is where we need to have change. With such
            strong role models for women in the technology industry we must strive to bring equality to the sector. Annie Easley, a 
            NASA rocket scientist and an advocate for gender and racial diversity in STEM. Easley’s vital work on the Centaur rocket project
            has laid foundations for space shuttle launches of the future. Radia Perlman: The Mother of the Internet, invented the algorithm
            behind the Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) which was significant in making the internet today possible.

            <p class="intro">
            Science is becoming more and more inclusive and many women are found to pursue futures in this area of STEM than any other. 
            Who can blame them with such role models as Katherine Johnson, the American mathematician whose calculations of orbital
            mechanics as a NASA employee were critical to the sucess of the first and subsequent U.S crewered spaceflights. You might
            be fimiliar with her works in the movie "Hidden Figures".
            Another great female mind in the world of science
            is Dorothy Hodgkin, best known for her work in developing crystallography of biochemical compounds. Hodgkin’s won a Nobel Prize 
            for her work with vitamin B-12.

            <p class="intro">
            In 2017 21.8% of undergraduate engineering students were women. This figure is slowly on the rise but we are still no where near
            gender equality in this line of work. That is where we need the young women of today to be inspired. Beatrix Shilling was a British
            mechanical engineer who also served in the Royal Aircraft Establishment in World War II. Shilling developed a way for Spitfire planes
            to dive while in combat as well as holding the title of fastes female racer! There are also such incredible minds as Edith Clarke, 
            who is known as the first female engineer. Clarke found it hard to earn a job as an engineer due to being female. After starting 
            out studying civil engineering she dropped out of that course and pursued a degree in electronic engineering instead. After
            graduating, Clarke invented the Clarke Calculator (a mathematical technique that calculates long distance transmission line). 
            More women are needed to make their mark on society and engineering is just the way to do it!

            <div class = "whitebanner2">Literature<br></div>
            <p class="intro">
            Every day, we get to honor the women out there who have done some extraordinary things, and this 
            includes women in literature. Many writers throughout time have displayed their talents in a way that have
            changed the world of literature forever. We all want to believe that people out there understand us. We want
            to know that we can do great things and that we can inspire others as well. It becomes a chain of inspiration 
            among writers, readers, and everyone else within their lives. When women share their voices, powerful things can happen.

            We have countless role models in the literature sector, specifically Jane Austen, the Brontë Sisters, Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie,
            and Alice Walker, all of whom have made astonishing impacts in the world of literature.

            <div class = "whitebanner2">Arts<br></div>
            <p class="intro">
            Although women artists have been involved in the making of art throughout history, their work, when compared to that of 
            their male counterparts, has been often obfuscated, overlooked and undervalued. However, Women in the British art world 
            are in a better position than ever before. They’re increasingly holding top roles in the sector and arts organisations 
            are working towards a better gender balance. Frances Morris was recently made Tate Modern’s first female director, and
            their galleries devoted three major 2015 shows to female artists – while at the Royal Academy of Arts, eight out of ten 
            Royal Academicians elected last year were women, from the architect Farshid Moussavi to the painter Vanessa Jackson. 
            They admit equal numbers of male and female students – and in fact, art schools across the country are commonly 
            now populated by more female students than male.<br><br>
